## 3.9 Item creation in town

For many parts, the creation of items in town is the same as that in the dungeon, but there are several differences and they are explained in this chapter. In the table below are listed what type of items you can buy from each person in town.

### **NPC Vendors and Items Sold**<sup>[^1]</sup>

| **Person**  | **Items Sold** |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Adria**  | Staves<sup>[^2]</sup>, books, scrolls, mana potions, rejuvenation potions, and elixirs<sup>[^3]</sup> |
| **Griswold** | Weapons (excluding staves<sup>[^4]</sup>), armor, helms, shields, and jewelry<sup>[^5]</sup> |
| **Pepin** | Healing potions, rejuvenation potions, Scroll of Resurrect, Scroll of Healing, and elixirs<sup>[^3][^5]</sup> |
| **Wirt**<sup>[^6]</sup> | Weapons (excluding staves<sup>[^4]</sup>), armor, helms, shields, and jewelry<sup>[^5]</sup> |

---

[^1]: Only *Griswold* and *Adria* will buy items.  
[^2]: In *Hellfire*, only staves *with spells* are sold.  
[^3]: Available once you reach level 26 in *multiplayer*, or after visiting *Hell*, *Crypt*, or *Hive* in *single player*.  
[^4]: In *Hellfire*, *Griswold* does sell staves.  
[^5]: Only available in *single player*.  
[^6]: For *special exceptions* regarding *Wirt*, see **chapter 3.9.4**.  

Just as for item creation in the dungeon we start by defining the ilvl for each person that you can shop from in town.

It is done in the table below.

| **Source of Item**        | **Definition of `ilvl`** |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Adria**                | `special`<sup>[^1]</sup> |
| **Griswold (basic items)**  | `special`<sup>[^1]</sup> |
| **Griswold (premium items)** | Varies from `clvl - 1` to `clvl + 2`<sup>[^2]</sup> |
| **Pepin**                | `special`<sup>[^1]</sup> |
| **Wirt**                 | `clvl` |

[^1]: See the table below for how `clvl` is converted to `ilvl` in *special cases*.  
[^2]: Maximum `ilvl` is **30** in all cases. In *Hellfire*, it varies from `clvl - 1` to `clvl + 3`. See the table below for exact variation.  


As noted in the table above, ilvl is in many cases derived in a special way; the table below explains how it is derived for Adria’s, Pepin’s and Griswold’s basic items. In multi player it depends on your character level. In single player it depends on what dungeon level you have been to in the current game. Difficulty does not affect it in any way.

**Definition of ilvl at Adria, Pepin and for Griswold’s basic items**

| **Single Player** | **Multi Player** |          |
|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| **`dlvl`**      | **`clvl`**       | **`ilvl`** |
| 1 - 4          | 1 - 9            | 6          |
| 5              | 10 - 11          | 7          |
| 6              | 12 - 13          | 8          |
| 7              | 14 - 15          | 9          |
| 8              | 16 - 17          | 10         |
| 9              | 18 - 19          | 11         |
| 10             | 20 - 21          | 12         |
| 11             | 22 - 23          | 13         |
| 12             | 24 - 25          | 14         |
| 13             | 26 - 27          | 15         |
| 14 - 16        | 28 - 50          | 16         |
| **Hive / Crypt**<sup>[^1]</sup> |                     | 16         |

[^1]: **Only available in *Hellfire*.**

For Griswold’s premium items the ilvl varies depending on what slot the items is created in (in his list of items). The table below explains exactly how.

#### Definition of `ilvl` for Griswold’s Premium Items

| 11                       | -          | `clvl + 1`            | `clvl + 1`            | `clvl + 1`            | `clvl + 1`            | `clvl + 1`            | `clvl + 1`             |

| 15                       | -          | `clvl + 3`            | `clvl + 3`            | `clvl + 3`            | `clvl + 3`            | `clvl + 3`            | `clvl + 3`             |

[^1]: **There are only six slots in *Diablo*.**

When you gain a level, the items in slot 1 and 2 (and 3 in Hellfire) are removed and items are pushed upwards so that slot 4 and 6 becomes empty (slot 11, 13 and 15 in Hellfire). Those empty slots are then refilled with new items of the appropriate ilvl matching the slot.

It is worth noticing that even if two characters are the same level they will be offered different items in town even if they are in the same game. Thus, it can be rewarding to ask others to check for any item you might want if you are playing multi player.


### 3.9.1 Adria

Adria has an unlimited supply of Potions of Mana, Potions of Full Mana and scrolls of Town Portal. In addition to those, Adria offers 7 to 14 random base items with a qlvl in the range below. She will renew her inventory each time you come back up from the dungeons or reload the game in single player.

Range of qlvl for base item:	1 to ilvl

The prefix, suffix and spell on the appropriate item is then chosen according to the ranges below:

Range of qlvl for spell (staff or book):	1 to ilvl

Range of qlvl for prefix on staff with spell:	1 to 2×ilvl

Range of qlvl for prefix and suffix on staff without spell:	ilvl to 2×ilvl

As the ilvl at Adria can never be higher than 16 (see table in chapter 3.9), there is a cap at qlvl 32 for prefixes and suffixes at Adria. For spells and base items the cap is at 16.


### 3.9.2 Griswold

Griswold has two types of items: basic ones that are not magical, and premier ones that are always magic.


**Basic items**

For the basic items he offers 10 to 19 random items with a qlvl in the range below.

Range of qlvl for base item:	1 to ilvl

As with items from normal monsters, bows has a double chance of being selected. He will renew his inventory of basic items each time you come back up from the dungeons or reload the game in single player.


**Premier items**

For the premier items, Griswold sells base items with a qlvl that follow the range listed below. He will offer 6 items in Diablo and 15 items in Hellfire. The qlvl of the prefix and suffix of magical items also follows the same range.

Range of qlvl for base item:	ilvl/4 to ilvl

Range of qlvl for prefixes and suffixes:	ilvl/2 to ilvl

- Maximum level of prefixes and suffixes at Griswold is 30.

- As already described, the ilvl varies a bit from item to item.

- Griswold will add a new item to his inventory as soon as you buy one of them. He will not change his inventory when you come back up from the dungeons but will change some of them when you gain a level.

- The exact procedure of choosing item type and prefixes and suffixes are the same as for magical items in the dungeon. See chapter 3.8 for more information.

In Hellfire there is an additional factor to consider. If possible he will try to sell items that are better (more expensive than 80% of your most expensive item) than the ones you are already carrying (both equipped ones and not equipped ones). The test is done separately for each item type group (amulet, armor, axe, bow, club, helm, ring, shield, staff and sword). If you don’t have any item of a type, any other item of that type is considered to be better. Thus to get progressively better items you should keep the most expensive item of each item type in your inventory. This check for better items is also done for items that are created to fill up a slot after you have leveled or bought one of his items. Also note that this works in Hellfire only. Sometimes you will see an item ”violating” this rule in Hellfire, as the game only tries a specific number of times, and if it has not found an item that matches in those tries it sticks with whatever item it generates next.


### 3.9.3 Pepin

Pepin has unlimited supply of Potions of Healing, Potions of Full Healing and scrolls of Resurrect (in multi player only). In addition to those, Pepin offers 7 to 14 random base items with a qlvl in the range below. He will renew his inventory each time you come back up from the dungeons or reload the game in single player.

Range of qlvl for base item:	1 to ilvl


### 3.9.4 Wirt

Wirt will only offer one item for sale and you have to pay 50 gold just to see it. The maximum qlvl of prefixes and suffixes is 60, which means he could theoretically sell any type of item otherwise possible in the game (of the types listed in the table in chapter 3.9) if it were not for the price limit (see chapter 3.10). He offers items whose base item has a qlvl in the range below.

Range of qlvl for base item:	1 to ilvl

The prefixes and suffixes are then chosen with a qlvl in the following range:

Range of qlvl for prefixes and suffixes:	ilvl to 2×ilvl

- If lower limit is higher than 25, it is set to 25.

- He seems to love items *of ages*. The reason for this is that there are not many suffixes of level 25 or above and most of them can exist on a very limited number of items or would make items too expensive.

He will renew the item only if you have bought the previous one and then gone into the dungeons or when you gain a new character level that is even.

In Hellfire, Wirt will only sell certain item types to you depending on your character class. The table below summarizes what items he will sell to each character class. Wirt will, in Hellfire, also try to offer you better (more expensive than 80% of your most expensive item) items than what you already have (both equipped ones and not equipped ones).

### Items Never Sold at Wirt in *Hellfire* by Class

| **Class**    | **Items Never Sold** |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Warrior**  | Bows, Staves         |
| **Rogue**    | Axes, Clubs, Swords, Staves, Shields |
| **Sorcerer** | Axes, Clubs, Bows, Staves |
| **Monk**     | Clubs, Bows, Shields, Medium Armor<sup>[^1]</sup> |
| **Bard**     | Axes, Clubs, Staves  |
| **Barbarian**| Bows, Staves         |

[^1]: See **Chapter 3.1** for the definition of *Medium Armor*.
